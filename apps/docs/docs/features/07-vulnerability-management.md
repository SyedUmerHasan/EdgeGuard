## Implementation Details

### CVE Integration Framework
```javascript
// Real-time vulnerability assessment
const vulnerabilityEngine = {
  cveFeeds: ['NIST-NVD', 'MITRE-CVE', 'vendor-advisories'],
  scanFrequency: 'continuous',
  riskScoring: 'CVSS-with-family-context',
  patchManagement: 'automated-with-rollback'
};

// Device vulnerability mapping
function assessDeviceVulnerabilities(device) {
  return {
    cveMatches: findApplicableCVEs(device.fingerprint),
    riskScore: calculateFamilyRisk(device.usage, device.exposure),
    patchAvailability: checkVendorUpdates(device.manufacturer),
    remediationPlan: generateFamilyGuidance(device.type)
  };
}
```

### Risk Scoring Algorithm
- **CVSS Base Score:** Industry-standard vulnerability severity rating
- **Family Context:** Device importance and usage patterns in home network
- **Exposure Assessment:** Internet accessibility and attack surface analysis
- **Remediation Feasibility:** Patch availability and deployment complexity

### Automated Patch Management
- **Vendor Integration:** Direct API connections for automated security updates
- **Testing Pipeline:** Sandbox validation ensuring patch compatibility
- **Deployment Scheduling:** Smart timing based on family usage patterns
- **Monitoring System:** Real-time verification of patch success and device health

## Success Metrics
